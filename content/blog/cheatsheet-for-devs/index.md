You read the title, you know what's coming, it's a cheat sheet full of cheats!

It's no joke that writing code is hard, unless you don't use AI, because for some reason AI generated code sometimes is the same as C++, it can blow you foot off!

So here are a list of some cheat sheets you should totally bookmark because they are a huge collection of them.

## 1. [DevHints.io](https://devhints.io/)

This is my personal favorite. Want to know why? Because it has a cheat sheet for vim! Now I can exit vim without much problem!

It's just so simple, plain, easy to read, easy to navigate, and covers every topic I want, and yes I said I and not everyone.

_Yes I can exit vim now!_

## 2. CSS grid cheat sheet

I'll be honest, I still don't know how to use grid in CSS. And this is the best thing I ever found.

_Funny stuff I did on the site_

The best part is, it works without any error, and even though it's less of a cheat sheet and more of a what would it look like site.

## 3. [OverAPI](https://overapi.com/)

In case you thought this is for API best practices... well it's not.

It's a cheat sheet post, not a best practices one.

OverAPI is not really a cheat sheet, but more of a web portal for resources. It contains a list of links of different resources, and I just included it for the incredible UI

_Can't show ads for copyright reasons_

It's just incredible, a portal for all your problems.

## 4. [List of cheat sheets](https://cheatography.com/programming/)

This has to be a better option, why? Because it's just a cheat sheet of cheat sheets. It has all the cheat sheets you need, this post is just hardly half of what is in this entire list, the title is also very concerning.

_2721 cheat sheets or just clickbait?_


And that's all. The title did say 5, but I will not mention another cheat sheet. Why? It's for fun.
