It's fun to code, but it's also annoying to code.

Of course, by this I mean it's difficult to code if you can't understand logically and the fact that you picture everything in your brain rather than testing it on some random software.

So without further waiting, let's get yetting.

## 1. [Figma](https://figma.com)

Being a front-end engineer doesn't mean you just write code, it also means you design the website, because all the back-end engineers don't know how to work with the CSS.

And when you work with a team it's important that you layout the design and then cross-check it before jumping into the code implementation of it.

For the help we use Figma.

In case you were wondering how I make those thumbnails... well here you have it.

## 2. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

If you're a backend engineer, then you are in luck!

Imagine creating an API for your app to communicate with the database and having exactly no idea if that code works or not, isn't that just frustrating?

Well if you are an old-school guy like me who uses the CLI... well then... cool... that's cool. But for most of us new guys, we prefer using our mouse like it's our only way to navigate!

Well, then Postman your way out of this one.

## 3. [Svg Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/)

Imagine you want to create an app, imagine you don't want to create any sort of icon for your app, imagine the solution to be...

SVG REPO!

It's a collection of icons in SVG format, and the best part is, it's all free!

## 4. [Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/)

Ever wondered how large your NPM package is? No? Well, you are a good-for-nothing developer!

It's not an industry standard, but I recommend checking your NPM package's bundle size... or else you will end up like me

_Bundle size of lambda_

## 5. [CloudCraft](https://www.cloudcraft.co/)

If you want to create something with AWS then you need this thing... also in case you use Azure it's available, but I mean, like... you know.

But still, it's useful.

Like, look at this accurate auth system!

Also in case you don't want to regret your life choices, it calculates the **minimum**(according to me) amount you will need to pay.

## 6. [Visbug](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/visbug/cdockenadnadldjbbgcallicgledbeoc)

In case being a front-end developer was hard, now it's at least a bit, or maybe a very little bit easy, just like **ez**pie... yeah you know where this is going! AH no, no ads today, sorry guys.

But, it's easy to create, or even steal a design from other sites easier!

Just take a look at me using this... Google Chrome extension, on my site.

In case you don't use [lambda](https://github.com/ezpie1/lambda-official)... really? It's the best social media app on Earth, so why not? The search bar isn't that long, it's just adjusted with the help of Visbug!

Cool right?

That's all the tools that you should give a try and that's all for this post, till then...

HAPPY HACKING!
