KEYBOARDS!

Everybody love ‘em! Minus me… I use a laptop.

But anyway, most of the people in the world use a keyboard. So much so that it’s a flipping $5B market!

But for programmers, keyboards hold a special place in our hearts.

We care about them more then our own family members, or friends… wait you have friends!? What kind of a programmer are you!?

And we’re starting off with a bang because of the ASMRs!

Now either you’re a Linux god or a crazy psycho who loves watching Primeagen vim really hard a lot.

but one thing is clear, you’re a sweat(don’t worry I’m also one), you can’t stop coding, and even if you stop for 1 second you go nuts!

And you have probably sacrificed a “child” in your life.

Which reminds me of

# Keyboard
Remember when keyboards used to look like keyboards?

Yeah, there’s nothing to talk about these guys. They are just…

uncool

# Unix Keyboard

Now we’re talking, these are those really cool guys, who are literal pros of programming who write pure C/C++ code without any memory leaks

I mean these guys are mostly nerds but they can’t possibly be as annoying as

# Mechanical Keyboard

God don’t get me started on these guys.

JUST STUPID! STUPID STUPID! THEY ARE A BUNCH OF CRIMINALS! AND NEED TO BE DECAPITATED!

Now mechanical keyboards and I don’t mix well, but all I can tell is… I once cut my finger while using one… don’t ask how.

If you see anyone using a mechanical keyboard, be prepared, they are about to make you deaf.

If you found any of these relatable.

Pat myself on me back. If not, I guess I’m a flipping weirdo after all
