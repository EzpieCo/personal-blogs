Just solve **you’re** problems.

That’s it! That’s all you need! THAT’S LIFE RIGHT THERE!

You see I’m a lazy guy, I can’t create 2 files and update a vite.config.ts simultaneously for my little visualization projects.

And then I got an idea, why not just create a script to do just that. It would make the project file, scenes, and add the project into the vite.config.ts for me with just one line in the terminal.

This forced me to learn **_BASH_** or as I like to call **_BLASH_**… don’t ask why.

Not only did I learn a useless skill, but this made my development workflow a millisecond faster, now I can open all my apps by just saying

```
$ bash GodMode.sh
```

And every time I faced a problem, I learned whatever would help me fix it. Like that one time, I thought automating my test suit would be a good idea and I ended up wasting 2 days just to fix a CircleCI problem.

That forced me to learn DevOps, a possibly useless skill if AI is popping up its ugly head.

Or Like that one instance, I forced myself to flex like ThePrimagen after watching this dude vim so hard.

And now I vim so hard that I forgot how to exit vim

So what’s the takeaway? Well, it’s definitely not a big Mac that’s for sure, but one thing is clear. Solve problems that you wish had solutions, don’t try to build the next big Facebook(oh wait that’s what I’m doing), just try to solve problems that you want to solve, and you want to get rid of, once you do that, I promise you’ll get addicted to programming as if it’s some sort of video game.
